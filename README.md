# Quickstart guide for the @serlo/editor-web-component in lit

[Lit](https://lit.dev/) is a webcomponent framework by Google. The [Serlo Editor](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@serlo/editor-web-component) integrates natively into any environment due to its support for webcomponents. This repo is a minimal barebones example on how to get a Serlo editor started in a lit environment.

Usually, lit is used with TypeScript but to keep the sample small we have opted for the tiniest example possible. All principles apply equally to any other environment that lit can be set up in.
